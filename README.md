This project is an object-oriented tool for generating photon spectra signals given a dark matter input model. Currently the code is setup only to run calculations specific to this paper from Boddy and et al. 	arXiv:1606.07440. Further advances in DMSG will be posted here. 

To run, make sure the following dependencies are installed. If possible pip install dependency_name will work.

DEPENDENCIES:
1) Numpy 
2) lmfit
3) mpmath
4) scipy
5) Matplotlib
